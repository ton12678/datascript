- Add `vector`, `hash-map`, `array-map`, `list` and `set` to built-in query functions (PR #186, thx [Linus Ericsson](https://github.com/claj))
- When filtering already filtered DB, filters were applied in the wrong order

# 0.15.4

- ~30% better performance for predicate and fn calls in queries (see #180)
- JS API now supports lookup refs in index lookups and queries (see #179)
- Lookup refs now work with `:db.unique/value` too (issue #171)

# 0.15.3

- Compatibility with 1.9 records (issue #176)
- Resolve query functions and predicates on JVM (issue #177, PR #178, thx [Luke VanderHart](https://github.com/levand))

# 0.15.2

- large long entity ids were breaking `init-db` (issue #165)

# 0.15.1

- `get-else` throws if `nil` is used for default value
- JS API: Do not keywordize attribute names in schema (PR #155, issue #153, thx [typeetfunc](https://github.com/typeetfunc))
- `init-db` sets correct `max-eid` when processing facts about transactions (PR #164, issue #163, thx [Nick Alexander](https://github.com/ncalexan))

# 0.15.0

- Better error messages for upsert conflicts
- Backtracking of tempids when redefining them later with upserts (issue #76)
- Upsert works in vector form too (issue #99, #109)
- Can specify transaction number in `:db/add`
- Can put datoms into transaction directly (issue #121: supports both addition and retration datoms, keeps tx number)
- Added all `datascript.core` symbols to externs so they can be called directly from JS (e.g. in combination with mori, issue #139)
- Added `reset-conn`, `conn-from-datoms` and `conn-from-db` (issue #45)

# 0.14.0

- Unify fn binding results with existing relations (PR #138, issue #141, thx [Aaron Brooks](https://github.com/abrooks))
- [ BREAKING ] `get-some` returns `[attr value]` instead of just `value` (#143, same as Datomic)
- [ BREAKING ] Returning `nil` from query function filters out tuple from result
- Throw when calling unbound predicate/function inside a query (#111)
- Added several built-ins, including `count` (#142) and `subs` (#111)

# 0.13.3

- Accept `nil` as old value in `:db.fn/cas` (PR #127, thx [Petter Eriksson](https://github.com/petterik))

# 0.13.2

- Fixed issue #120 with binding of large collections

# 0.13.1

- Guard `conn?` will check that value is derefable instead of checking for `(instance? Atom)`

# 0.13.0

- **[ BREAKING ] Main namespace to include is now `datascript.core`, not `datascript`**
- [ BREAKING ] Old `datascript.core` (internal namespace) was renamed to `datascript.db`
- [ BREAKING ] `datascript.shim` (internal namespace) was renamed to `datascript.arrays`

Motivations:

- Usage of top-level namespaces is discouraged and even generates a warning in CLJS.
- Better sooner than later.
- 0.13 seems like a great number for this sort of release.

Migration procedure:

- Just change `(require '[datascript :as d])` to `(require '[datascript.core :as d])` and you’re good to go.

For the sake of easy migration, there’re no other changes in this release. Just renamings.

# 0.12.2

- Fix null pointer exception when `contains?` is called with an entity (PR #114, thx [Kevin Lynagh](https://github.com/lynaghk))

# 0.12.1

- `db-init` respects `:db/index` property

# 0.12.0

[ BREAKING ] Introducing new `:db/index` schema attribute:

- Attributes are not put to AVET _by default_ anymore
- Following attributes are put to AVET:

  - `:db/index true`
  - `:db/unique :db.unique/identity`
  - `:db/unique :db.unique/value`
  - `:db/valueType :db.type/ref`

- All attributes put to AVET should be comparable. Note: maps and list are not comparable by default, vectors are compared value-by-value
- [ BREAKING ] Min/max aggregation functions will only work on a comaparable values

Benefits:

- You can finally store _any_ trash easily and reliably in DataScript database: maps, vectors, functions, JS objects. It doesn’t even have to be comparable. Just do not mark it as `:db/index` and do not make it `:db.cardinality/many`
- Faster transactions. There’s ⅓ less indexes to fill
- Good defaults. Most cases where you’ll probably use AVET (lookup by value)—lookup refs, external ids, references—they are all indexed by default

Caveats:

- Your code may break (see below)
- Queries can do lookup by value event without `:db/index` attribute, but it’ll be slower

Migration procedure:

- Check your code for `datoms`, `seek-datoms` calls with `:avet` index, and `index-range` call
- Check your queries to see if they utilize AVET index. It happens when you use this pattern: `[?free-var <constant-attr> <constant-value>]`
- Mark necessary attributes with `:db/index true` in the schema

# 0.11.5

- Ported BTSet to JVM

  - no sorting optimisation for `init-db`

Performance numbers so far ([raw data](https://gist.github.com/tonsky/9da339f87113e1f1a395)):

- queries with single clause, no join: 30–50% faster 
- queries with joins: ~50% slower
- `transact`: ~3.5–4 times faster
- `init-db`: ~2–2.5 times slower
- rules: ~2–5 times faster
